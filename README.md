# Guessing Game on Premier League Footballers

## How it works:
- The program will generate a dataframe from the sofifa.com homepage, filtered to only Premier League players to make it guessable for regular people. 
from top trending PL players, a random one is selected and at each wrong guess a characteristic about the player is given to the user as a tip, 
starting with his preferred position and with a maximum of 4 guesses per round.
